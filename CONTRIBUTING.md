# Submitting issues

**Must read:** [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

### IMPORTANT

1. When you file an issue, your **responsibility** is to provide **ALL** the exact steps needed for me to reproduce an issue.
1. Ideally, never should I have to _guess_ how to reproduce an issue.
    - Hence this is why very detailed steps must be very carefully written down **the first time** the issue is filed.
1. Every single step, in order, must be provided, with **ALL** relevant details.
1. Screenshots are nice, but use common sense: I can't cut and paste important text information from screenshots.
    - Regarding screenshots: common sense, common sense, common sense. Too much of a thing can easily end up as noise.
1. Open source quality software comes from contributors carefully **crafting** code: conversely, issues must also be carefully **crafted** by other contributors.
    - In other words: you benefit from the carefully crafted code, return the favor by **carefully** crafting issues/bug reports.
1. If your mindset is that your time is more precious than that of my time, refrain from filing issues.
